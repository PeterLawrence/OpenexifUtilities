                                12/12/2003
                                
I. Recent changes or Bugs Fixed in this release
- Fixed bug related to setting the compression parameters through ExifImageFile.
  None of the parameters set were actually being used when doing the compression
  because of the creation of the temporary file. Now it should all work as
  expected.
- Fixed bug that was causing crash when certain invalid metadata was
  encountered. (Better handling of corrupted files).
- Other minor fixes and style changes.

II. New Features
- Now, ICC Profiles can be set through ExifImageFile (and ExifJpegImage). This
  creates them in an application segment 2 (0xFFE2) with "ICC_PROFILE" as the
  identifier. This is still a work in progress and will only work when calling
  the setICCProfile method sometime before calling writeScanLines. If you don't
  call writeScanLines, it won't work properly.
- Access to horizontal and vertical sampling factors are provided by 
  getHSamplingFactor and getVSamplingFactor methods.
- Smoothing F=factor, progressive mode, and encoding optimization can now be
  set through the setSmoothingFactor, setOptimization, and setProgressive
  methods.

III. Known Bugs and Limitations
- APP2 is not implemented yet, but can be accessed as raw data.
- ICC Profile limitations as described above.
